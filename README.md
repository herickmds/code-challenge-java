# Code Challenge Java

## Challenge Overview:

You are tasked with building a web application that allows users to create and manage their to-do lists. The application should consist of a responsive webpage built in React, and an API built in Java Spring Boot to store and manage the to-do lists.

### The Repositories
- **Frontend**: Built with React. You can also choose another React framework if you prefer.
- **Backend**: Built with Java Spring Boot, utilizing any database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or in-memory).

### The Layout
Refer to the provided [layout mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/sQrUVHTlyogq3qGdkqGTXN/mockup?node-id=7%3A2&t=ANTOTiqjqGWYuoUr-0) for both desktop and mobile versions. Please follow this design as closely as possible.

### Functionality Requirements:

1. Users should be able to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** to-do items using the API.
2. Users should be able to **mark an item as a favorite**.
3. Users should be able to **assign a color** to each to-do item.
4. The React frontend should display the user's to-do list in a responsive and visually appealing manner, with the ability to **filter** by favorite items and color.
5. Favorited items should appear at the top of the list.

### Technical Requirements:
1. **Backend API**:
   - Built using **Java Spring Boot**.
   - Use any database of your choice (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, in-memory, etc.).
2. **Frontend**:
   - Built using **React** and modern web development tools.
3. **Responsive Design**:
   - The application should be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.

### Deliverables:

1. A link to a GitHub repository containing the complete source code for both the **backend** and **frontend**.
2. A written description of how to set up and run the application locally.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Code Quality**: Well-structured and maintainable code.
2. **Code Format**: Consistent and follows best practices.
3. **Code Performance**: Efficient and scalable solutions.
4. **Frontend Design**: A user-friendly, visually appealing interface.
5. **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand and maintain?
6. **Mobile-First Approach**: The design should prioritize mobile responsiveness.
7. **Code Responsibility**: Clean separation of concerns (frontend vs. backend).
8. **Feature Completeness**: Does the app meet all the listed functional requirements?
9. **Responsiveness**: Does the app work well across different screen sizes?
10. **Best Practices**: Use of modern web tools and standards.
11. **Design**: Does the app follow the provided design mockup?
12. **Documentation**: Well-documented code and setup instructions.

### Backend:
1. **Java**: Version 11+
2. **Framework**: Spring Boot
3. **Database**: Choose your own, or use an in-memory database (e.g., H2).

### Frontend:
1. **Node**: ^16.15.0
2. **NPM**: ^8.5.5
3. **Framework**: React
4. **CSS**: Sass or another preprocessor of your choice.

### Want to Impress Us Even More?

1. Correctly define types and interfaces.
2. Set up and enforce **ESLint** rules.
3. Create a **Prettier** configuration for consistent formatting.
4. Containerize the app with **Docker**.
5. Write unit and integration **tests**.
6. Set up **CI/CD** pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### Instructions for Submission:

1. Create a file `PULL_REQUEST.md` in which you describe your process, the decisions you made, and any important details about the implementation.
2. Create a pull request for both the **backend** and **frontend** repositories using the same branch name.
3. Send us the pull request and you're done!
